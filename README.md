# micro_assembly_rules
Data and code from:
> Friedman, Jonathan, Logan M. Higgins, and Jeff Gore. "Community structure follows simple assembly rules in microbial microcosms." Nature ecology & evolution 1.5 (2017): 0109.

 The `data` folder contains all the experimental data used in the paper. See the `notes` file for details.  
 The `code` folder contains an implementation of the assembly rules proposed in the paper, as well as simulations of communities following gLV dynamics used to assess the assembly rules accuracy for such dynamics.
